A simple humidity sensor using the {Adafruit-Feather-RP2040}, a 2.9" Waveshare e-Paper Module monochrome, and SHTC3 humidity sensor, written in {Rust}.

== Hardware

All the hardware components in my particular build are enumerated here.

.Fan Controller Components
* {Adafruit-Feather-RP2040}
* https://www.adafruit.com/product/4636[Adafruit Sensirion SHTC3 Temperature & Humidity Sensor]
* https://www.adafruit.com/product/64[Half-size breadboard]
* https://www.adafruit.com/product/3898[Lithium Ion Polymer Battery Ideal For Feathers - 3.7V 400mAh]
* https://www.adafruit.com/product/4399[STEMMA QT / Qwiic JST SH 4-Pin Cable - 50mm Long]
* https://www.adafruit.com/product/752[SWD 0.05" Pitch Connector - 10 Pin SMT Box Header]
* https://www.waveshare.com/product/2.9inch-e-paper-module.htm[Waveshare 2.9inch E-Ink display module]

Programming will require a USB-C cable and a computer.

== How it Works

The humidity sensor queries and displays the temperature and humidity every 20 minutes.

== Getting Started

. Install {rustup}.
+
[,sh]
----
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
----

. Clone the repository.
+
[,sh]
----
git clone https://github.com/jwillikers/humble-humidity-sensor.git
----

. Change to the project's directory.
+
[,sh]
----
cd humble-humidity-sensor
----

. Install the {Rust} toolchain for the RP2040.
+
[,sh]
----
rustup target add thumbv6m-none-eabi
----

. Install {flip-link}
+
[,sh]
----
cargo install flip-link
----

. To flash the microcontroller over USB-C, change the `.cargo/config.toml` file to use `elf2uf2-rs` as the runner.
+
..cargo/config.toml
[,toml]
----
runner = "elf2uf2-rs -d"

# runner = "probe-run --chip RP2040"
----

. Install {elf2uf2-rs}.
+
[,sh]
----
cargo install elf2uf2-rs
----

. While holding the `BOOT` button, attach the Adafruit Feather RP2040 to your computer using the USB-C port.

. Flash the board using Cargo's `run` subcommand.
+
[,sh]
----
cargo run
----

== SWD

An SWD connection is more convenient for flashing and debugging the microcontroller.
It doesn't require fiddling with the tiny buttons on the dev-board constantly.
If you've soldered an SWD debug header to the Feather RP2040, it's pretty accessible.
The {hs-probe} debugger from the {probe-rs} project works great.

. Attach the debugger to your computer.

. Attach the debugger to the Feather RP2040's SWD header.

. To flash the microcontroller over SWD, make sure that the `.cargo/config.toml` file sets the runner to `probe-run`.
+
..cargo/config.toml
[,toml]
----
# runner = "elf2uf2-rs -d"

runner = "probe-run --chip RP2040"
----

. Install {probe-run}.
+
[,sh]
----
cargo install probe-run
----

. Flash the board using Cargo's `run` subcommand.
+
[,sh]
----
cargo run
----

== Todo

* Reduce power consumption by putting XOSC into dormant mode and waking via ROSC.
* Use partial refresh to only update the necessary portion of the screen for new measurements.
* Add more pizzazz to the display.
* Add GitHub CI actions.
* Add pre-commit hooks?
* Include pictures in README.
